Hello Welcome to the most epic dungeon crawler made by some noob in coding lol

1. Start by creating your character using a wide series of options
2. Explore the dungeon and try to find an escape!
3. Choose between fighting or using non violent tactics to make your way through
4. Find loot and upgrade your character!
5. I heard there are secrets and LOOOOOOOOORE in the dungeon have fun finding them :)

   Note for the dev (me aka alec aka big guy aka funny man):

   please dont forget to push and pull for every time you implement a thing for your project!
